# swapdrop.v2.backend

Django REST framework API to serve as the backend for Swapdrop - a social clothes swapping platform founded by my brother in spring 2020. You can see the code for the first version of the website [here](https://github.com/lukasmyth96/SWAPDROP) where I also give more information about what Swapdrop. I built this with David ([Da-Byte](https://github.com/Da-byte)) summer 2020. Unfortunatley we didn't have time to finish this version of the site before the company folded but we had great fun working on it and learnt a lot about DRF.
